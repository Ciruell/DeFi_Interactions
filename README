I Created this repository trying to interact with the DeFi as a newbie:
    sharing there my accomplishments.
These files/functions can be used in building more complex programs like:
    data scraping/data manipulation, arbitrage bots, frontrunning bots and more...

**PLEASE BE ADVISED:**
Some can be outdated, please do not only build on my files and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCHES!

To get started install all the dependecies like web3 (pip install web3).
If you are getting errors try to change the compilator or the compilator version.
