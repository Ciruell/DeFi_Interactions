I Created this repository trying to interact with the DeFi as a newbie:
    sharing there my accomplishments.
These files/functions can be used in building more complex programs like:
    data scraping/data manipulation, arbitrage bots, frontrunning bots and more...

AS OF TODAY YOU CAN FIND:
Price Scraping of a desired Pair of token from UniSwap and SushiSwap on Ethereum Chain.
Price Scraping of a desired Pair of token from SaucerSwap on Hedera Chain.


**PLEASE BE ADVISED:**
Some can be outdated, please do not only build on my files and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCHES!

TO GET STARTED:
Install all the dependecies like web3 (pip install web3).
If you are getting errors try to change the compilator or the compilator version.
Change the EndPoints with yours.
